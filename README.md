# AutoHyperTune  

## Overview  
AutoHyperTune is a repository dedicated to automatic hyperparameter tuning in machine learning. It serves as a knowledge base for researchers, engineers, and practitioners who want to explore various hyperparameter optimization techniques, libraries, and tutorials.  

Hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in model optimization, significantly impacting the model's performance. This repository compiles various methods, libraries, and resources to facilitate efficient tuning.  

## Why Hyperparameter Tuning?  
Hyperparameters control how a model learns. The right set of hyperparameters can lead to better generalization and improved accuracy. Manual tuning is often tedious and computationally expensive, which is why automated hyperparameter optimization is essential.
